***The first portion of code utilizes the data set "Master Plastics Analysis.csv" in order to:***

1)  ***Calculate and visualize how many microplastic (MP) particles on average were recovered from each sampling event and during each season (normalized for the amount of water sampled). Box plots are used to show averages and variation.***

2)  ***Explore the characteristics (morphology, color, size, and polymer type) of recovered plastic particles, particularly whether there are observable patterns in spatial or temporal variables using data visualizations. Bar graphs are used to show proportions of each characteristic out of the entire observed population of plastic particles.***

***Note that figure and table numbers refer to their order in this R-markdown document.***

**Figure 1. Average concentration of MPs observed at NB sampling sites across the Spring, Summer/Fall, and Winter seasons.** When considering seasonal variation, particle concentrations were consistently highest in the northern portion of NB throughout all seasons (Sites 1, 2, and 3), with high variability across seasons in the southern portion of NB (Sites 4, 5, 6). Site 5 exhibited a major spike in MP yield during the Winter season that was not observed consistently at other sampling sites. These findings highlight the spatial and seasonal dynamics of pollution in Narragansett Bay, emphasizing the importance of improved targeted monitoring and management strategies in mitigating MP pollution.

**Figures 2 and 3. Morphology of MPs across seasons and sites.** Morphology was not significantly variable across seasons or sites sampled, with fragments comprising the majority of particles recovered. Fibers and beads were also present but in relatively lower quantities. These results suggest that the assemblage of microplastics in Narragansett Bay remains consistent across seasons and sites, with fragmented particles being the dominant form. Understanding the morphology of MPs provides insights into potential sources and pathways of pollution in the bay.Â \

**Figures 4 and 5. Proportion of MP particle colors observed across seasons and sites.** Â A diverse range of particle colors was identified, with white, clear, blue, and black being the dominant colors, collectively comprising a significant proportion of the observed MPs. Importantly, the proportions of different colors did not show significant variation across different sites or seasons, suggesting a consistent color distribution pattern in the plastics present in Narragansett Bay.

**Figure 6.** **Average MP length at each site by season.** In Spring, Sites 2, 3, 4, and 5 displayed the shortest particle length, indicating a prevalence of smaller-sized microplastics during this season. However, in Winter, these same sites exhibited the longest particle length, suggesting an increase in the proportion of larger-sized MPs. These findings suggest that seasonal dynamics are a stronger driver of differences in particle length than site location.

**Figures 7 and 8. Proportions of identified MP polymer types by season and site.** Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were found to be the predominant polymer types, comprising over 87% of all recovered MPs. The proportions of polymer types did not exhibit significant variation among different sites or seasons. It is important to acknowledge that the surface trawl sampling method used in this study is more likely to capture low-density floating particles, which may explain the higher representation of PE, PP, and polystyrene (PS) in the recovered samples.

**Figure 9. Relationship between latitude and MP concentrations in Narragansett Bay surface water.** Scatter plot showing the distribution of particle yields (Particles/meter3) across different latitudes in Narragansett Bay. The red regression line represents the linear relationship between latitude and particle yields.. Blue data points represent individual sample event observations. The plot demonstrates a significant positive relationship (p = 0.00927), indicating that particle yields tend to increase as latitude increases in Narragansett Bay. The plot provides insights into the spatial distribution of MPs in the bay and highlights the potential influence of predictors (freshwater inputs, population density, stormwater runoff) on MP pollution patterns.
